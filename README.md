# Telechat-Synth ðŸ’¬

Telechat-Synth is a Telegram chatbot that utilizes various language models and speech synthesis technologies to provide interactive conversational experiences. It leverages OpenAssistant's "oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5" chat model for generating responses, the Whisper model for converting audio to text, and the Bark TTS (Text-to-Speech) model for converting text to audio.

## Features

- Real-time chat conversation with the chatbot powered by OpenAssistant's language model.
- Voice input support: Convert voice messages to text using the Whisper model.
- Text-to-Speech synthesis: Generate audio responses using the Bark TTS model.

## Models Used

- [OpenAssistant's Chat Model](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5): The chat model used for generating responses in the chatbot.
- [Whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base.en): The Whisper model used for converting audio to text.
- [Bark TTS](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark): The Bark TTS model used for converting text to audio.

- Python 3.9 or higher installed
- Hugging Face API Key: Get it from [Hugging Face Account Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
- Telegram Bot API Key: Obtain it by creating a bot using the BotFather on Telegram

## Setup

1. Clone the Telechat-Synth repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Edit the `~/app/config.py` file in the project directory. Replace the placeholders with your API keys:
   ```python
   # Paste your Hugging Face API KEY
   HF_API_KEY = 'HF API KEY'  # hf_*******************************

   # Paste your Telegram Bot API KEY
   TELEBOT_API_KEY = 'TELEBOT API KEY'

   # BOT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION: Add any specific instructions for the bot, such as a Jailbreak or additional behavior.
   BOT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = ''

   # SYSTEM_REFRESH: If your instructions have a constant phrase or word, paste it here.
   SYSTEM_REFRESH = ''

   # Bark TTS Settings
   BARK_SMALL_MODELS = True  # Set to True if using models < 4GB
   SPEAKER = 'v2/en_speaker_9'
   ```

5. Customize the `BOT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` and `SYSTEM_REFRESH` variables as needed to define specific behaviors for your chatbot.
6. Start the Telechat-Synth chatbot by running the following command:
   ```
   python ~/app/run.py
   ```
7. Interact with the chatbot by sending messages on Telegram.

## Usage
